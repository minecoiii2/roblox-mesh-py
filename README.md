Hi, i'm not the best python dev but i hacked this up in a couple of days and it's good enough for me.
This is a translated version of https://github.com/MaximumADHD/cage-mesh-deformer/blob/main/Modules/RobloxMesh.lua which was coded in Luau

bufferlua:
I was too lazy to learn how to use python StringIO or BytesIO modules so i just recoded what MaximumADHD did and translated it in python

robloxmesh:
Only works with version 2+ files

TODO:
I still have to add version detection or whatever, and fix bones or check if bones even work
